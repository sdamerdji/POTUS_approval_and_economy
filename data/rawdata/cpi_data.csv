CPUSAM,United States BLS Consumer Price Index Inflation Rate NSA,Consumer Price Indices,United States Dollar,United States,,,,OTC QX Market,,,Index Number,Units,Stock,none,Annual From Dec 1789 To Dec 1874<BR>Monthly From Jan 1875 To Mar 2019<BR>,"Sources: U.S. Government, Statistical Abstract of the United States (1820-1874), Carl Snyder, ""A New Index of the General Price Level from 1875,"" Journal of the American Statistical Association (June 1924); Bureau of Labor Statistics (1913-). See also David, Paul A. and Solar, Peter, ""A Bicentenary Contribution to the History of the Cost of Living in America,"" Research in Economic History (1977), pp. 1-80.<br />Notes: This index is based a combination of four indices. David and Solar are used from 1789 to 1820. From 1820 through 1874, the annual cost-of-living index calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank is used. From 1875 until 1912, it uses a monthly Index of General Prices calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which was weighted between wholesale commodity prices (20%) Wage payments (35%), the Cost of Living (35%) and Rents (10%). From 1913 on, the Bureau of Labor's Consumer Price Index is used. For information on how the prices of individual goods have changed, see Scott Derks, ed., The Value of a Dollar, Lakeville, CT: Grey House Publishing, 1999.<br />The Consumer Price Index (CPI), 1982-84=100, is calculated on the basis of a market basket of 305 entry level items representing all goods and services purchased for everyday living by all residents in urban areas. These residents include about 87 percent of the total civilian noninstitutional population, including wage earners and clerical workers, professional, managerial, and technical workers, short-term workers, the self-employed, the unemployed, retirees, and others not in the labor force. <br />For most item categories, representing approximately 61 percent of the total expenditure weight, basic indexes are compiled using a geometric mean formula. For the remaining item categories, basis indexes are computed using a modified Laspeyres methodology<br />Each month 80,000 price quotations are obtained from approximately 23,000 outlets. About 50,000 housing units are contacted to collected data on rents. Prices are usually collected during the first 18 working days (Monday-Friday) of the month. Food, rent, utilities, and some other items are priced monthly in all urban areas. Most other items are priced monthly in three large urban areas, and every second month in other areas. Most pricing is conducted by personal interview; some pricing takes place by telephone. The prices include any applicable taxes, discounts and rebates. <br />The weights for the CPI are derived from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys for 1993-95, and the average for those 3 years. Historically weights have been revised once every 10 years; however, starting in 2002, weights will be revised every other year. Seasonally adjusted indices are also published.",,Inflation adjusted.
