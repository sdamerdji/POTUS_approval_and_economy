High exports is good if it's a large percent of gdp.
```{r}
(exports <- read.csv("../data/rawdata/export_data.csv", skip = 2) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(Date)) %>%
  select(date, Percent_Gdp) %>%
  rename(export_change = Percent_Gdp))

write.csv(exports, file = "../data/cleandata/export.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
